# Online News Popularity 


## Gentle Introduction
This analysis is conducted on the Online News Popularity [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+News+Popularity), acquired initially on January 8, 2015, through the courtesy of UCI Machine Learning Repository, Mashable, Kelwin Fernandes, Pedro Vinagre, Paulo Cortez, and Pedro Sernadela.

There are n=39,797 observations within this data set and 61 attributes. Of these 61 attributes, I have elected to remove 4. Therefore, this analysis is centered on a total of p=56 predictors and one response variable, the absolute value of title subjectivity. The absolute value of title subjectivity allows one to visualize how specific predictors influence the measurement of variance in title subjectivity. All variables and descriptions can be accessed through the dataset link provided.

For this regression analysis, several techniques such as lasso, ridge, elastic-net, random forest, cross-validation, R-Squared tests, and bootstrapped error bars are leveraged to measure the relationship of predictors onto the response variable.
